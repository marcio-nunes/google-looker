## What is Looker?

At the conclusion of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Recognize and articulate at a high level the value proposition of the Looker platform
- Recognize and articulate Looker’s role in the data analysis process

Looker can help you:

- See the data your company collects.
- Answer questions as you have them.
- Stay up date with the status of your business.
- Use data for daily decisions, instead of waiting for reports.

To consider how Looker can support your data workflows, let’s examine the overall data analysis
process and the role of Looker in this process.

When working with data, it’s important to have clear objectives.

Data analysis process:

1. **Define questions**: Identify what questions need to be answered using your data.
2. **Identify required data**: Determine the specific dimensions and measures you will need to answer those questions.
3. **Analyze data**: Explore the dimension and/or measure relationships via tables and visualizations.
    - This exploration of your data should empower you to take some kind of action or make some kind of decision with regard to your work.
5. **Interpret results**: Glean actionable insights from your analyzed data.

Looker can support you throughout this process. For example, you can explore your data in Looker to help you define questions and identify necessary datasets.

Then, you can use Looker to analyze and visualize data to answer your questions.

Last, you can share visualizations and dashboards with your stakeholders to facilitate discussion on the results and identify next steps.

Independent of the datasets used, this data analysis process is transferable and can provide a useful framework for thinking about how Looker can be integrated into your existing workflows.

## The Looker platform

At the conclusion of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Recognize and detail the primary components of the Looker user interface.
- Recognize and articulate the audience and purpose of the primary components of the Looker user interface.

Looker is a browser-based cloud application, you access it by opening an internet browser.

When you first log in to the Looker platform, your home page may vary depending on what your company’s Looker administrator has configured.

**Folders** in Looker are where content lives, just as files in your computer or Google Drive are stored in folders.

**Looks** are standalone reports or visualizations, while dashboards contain more than one visualization.

The left-side panel provides the content navigation options for users that have been added to the Looker instance as data viewers, which are users who need to find existing  information quickly and easily. 

> Data viewers do not create their own reports and visualizations.

**Explore** - If you have been added as a data explorer to a Looker instance, you will also see the Explore tab in the left panel of the Looker UI.

As a data explorer, you use Explores to ask questions of your data and create visualizations and reports that can be shared with others such as data viewers.

Explores are curated by Looker developers in a proprietary templating language called **LookML**. The Explores that you have been given access to will be listed under this Explore tab.
