## What is Looker?

At the conclusion of this lesson, you will be able to

- Recognize and articulate at a high level the value proposition of the Looker platform
- Recognize and articulate Looker’s role in the data analysis process

Looker can help you:

- See the data your company collects.
- Answer questions as you have them.
- Stay up date with the status of your business.
- Use data for daily decisions, instead of waiting for reports.

To consider how Looker can support your data workflows, let’s examine the overall data analysis
process and the role of Looker in this process.

When working with data, it’s important to have clear objectives.

Data analysis process:

1. **Define questions**: Identify what questions need to be answered using your data.
2. **Identify required data**: Determine the specific dimensions and measures you will need to answer
those questions.
3. **Analyze data**: Explore the dimension and/or measure relationships via tables and visualizations.
    - This exploration of your data should empower you to take some kind of action or make some kind of
decision with regard to your work.
5. **Interpret results**: Glean actionable insights from your analyzed data.

Looker can support you throughout this process. For example, you can explore your data in Looker to
help you define questions and identify necessary datasets.

Then, you can use Looker to analyze and visualize data to answer your questions.

Last, you can share visualizations and dashboards with your stakeholders to facilitate discussion on the
results and identify next steps.

Independent of the datasets used, this data analysis process is transferable and can provide a useful
framework for thinking about how Looker can be integrated into your existing workflows.
