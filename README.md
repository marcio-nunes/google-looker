## What is Looker?

At the conclusion of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Recognize and articulate at a high level the value proposition of the Looker platform
- Recognize and articulate Looker’s role in the data analysis process

Looker can help you:

- See the data your company collects.
- Answer questions as you have them.
- Stay up date with the status of your business.
- Use data for daily decisions, instead of waiting for reports.

To consider how Looker can support your data workflows, let’s examine the overall data analysis
process and the role of Looker in this process.

When working with data, it’s important to have clear objectives.

Data analysis process:

1. **Define questions**: Identify what questions need to be answered using your data.
2. **Identify required data**: Determine the specific dimensions and measures you will need to answer those questions.
3. **Analyze data**: Explore the dimension and/or measure relationships via tables and visualizations.
    - This exploration of your data should empower you to take some kind of action or make some kind of decision with regard to your work.
5. **Interpret results**: Glean actionable insights from your analyzed data.

Looker can support you throughout this process. For example, you can explore your data in Looker to help you define questions and identify necessary datasets.

Then, you can use Looker to analyze and visualize data to answer your questions.

Last, you can share visualizations and dashboards with your stakeholders to facilitate discussion on the results and identify next steps.

Independent of the datasets used, this data analysis process is transferable and can provide a useful framework for thinking about how Looker can be integrated into your existing workflows.

## The Looker platform

At the conclusion of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Recognize and detail the primary components of the Looker user interface.
- Recognize and articulate the audience and purpose of the primary components of the Looker user interface.

Looker is a browser-based cloud application, you access it by opening an internet browser.

When you first log in to the Looker platform, your home page may vary depending on what your company’s Looker administrator has configured.

**Folders** in Looker are where content lives, just as files in your computer or Google Drive are stored in folders.

**Looks** are standalone reports or visualizations, while dashboards contain more than one visualization.

The left-side panel provides the content navigation options for users that have been added to the Looker instance as data viewers, which are users who need to find existing  information quickly and easily. 

> Data viewers do not create their own reports and visualizations.

- **Explore menu** - If you have been added as a data explorer to a Looker instance, you will also see the Explore tab in the left panel of the Looker UI.

As a data explorer, you use Explores to ask questions of your data and create visualizations and reports that can be shared with others such as data viewers.

Explores are curated by Looker developers in a proprietary templating language called **LookML**. The Explores that you have been given access to will be listed under this Explore tab.

- **Develop menu** is used by LookML developers to curate the Explores that are accessible to data explorers via the Explore tab.

Within the Develop environment, developers can specify which fields are available in each Explore, how each field appears, and the logic or behavior for each field. Developers can use the toggle button at the bottom left-side of the UI to enter Development Mode to make and test changes to LookML code before sending the changes to production.

> At your organization, you may not see a Develop menu if that is not part of your role.

- **Admin menu** Looker administrators use the Admin menu to configure the users, permissions, and other settings for the Looker instance such as database connections.

> At your organization, you may not see an Admin menu if that is not part of your role.

- **Recently viewed** - you can access your recent Looker content browsing history in Recently viewed. This might be useful if you need to access a report from a day or two ago.

- **Favorites** - When you do find something that you want to save for future reference, you can add it as a favorite. This section will contain all of your
bookmarked dashboards and Looks.

- **Boards** serve as a useful way of organizing content, such as saving multiple Looks and dashboards onto one board that you can share with others.

- **Folders** - if your Looker administrator has installed any tools or Blocks (which are pre-built data models from the Looker Marketplace), they would also show up in this left-side panel.
    - **My folder** - Each user has a personal folder with their name on it; in the current view, it is labeled as My folder. For you as a Looker user, this is your own scratch space for works in progress, as well as a storage space for content that is only meaningful to you or your role.
    - **All folders** - you can go to the People folder under All folders to see other users’ personal folders.

From the top-right, you’ll see four icons:

1. **Magnifying glass** allows you to search across the Looker instance by keyword and also links you back to Looker Connect for learning assistance.
2. **Looker Marketplace** is where you can find applications and tools to get more out of your data.
3. **Help icon** provides links to chat support, docs, a user guide, and more.
4. **User** icon is where you’ll find access to information associated with your Looker account.
5. **Settings icon** if you have admin access, a fifth gear icon will appear between the Looker Marketplace and help icons that allows access to the admin settings page.
